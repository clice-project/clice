clice is a next-generation language server designed for modern C++. Through excellent asynchronous task scheduling and intelligent caching, it achieves a lower memory footprint and faster response times.

Beyond performance, clice provides instantiation-aware template processing, supports switching header contexts between different source files (including non-self-contained headers), and offers comprehensive support for C++20 modules, from code completion to go-to-definition. Our goal is to provide C++ developers with a truly fast, precise, and intelligent development companion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for header contexts and C++20 modules are core features currently under active development. They will be progressively refined in upcoming releases. Stay tuned!

## Getting started

Download clice from releases and install [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ykiko.clice-vscode), Then add `.vscode/settings.json`

```cpp
{
    // Optional: Set this to an empty string to turn off the clangd.
    "clangd.path": "",

    // Point this to the clice binary you downloaded.
    "clice.executable": "/path/to/your/clice/executable",
}
```

> [!NOTE]
